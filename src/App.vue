		<p>If you're reading this, you've likely been caught red-handed talking about non-Modrinth stuff in the #modrinth-discussion channel! ðŸ˜²</p>
		<p>
			Do you have any idea what you've done!? The Modrinth team works hard to keep that channel on-topic! Who do you think you are, just waltzing on in and
			talking about something that's not Modrinth?? Just look how hard they have to work to keep this channel a civilized place:

		This is actually mostly just a repository of my personal favorite messages from the Modrinth staff (mostly Emma/triphora) telling people they've gone
		off-track. Hey, maybe you'll enjoy them as much as I do. Enjoy a nice fat list:
